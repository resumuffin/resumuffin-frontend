        <h2>What do the tags do?</h2>
        <hr>
        <span>Tags allow your resumé to be searchable by other users who want to provide feedback on your resumé. Tags should specify information about your resumé and the positions you will be using it to apply for. For example, if you were searching for full stack developer jobs for a new graduate, example tags could include: "Computer Science", "Full Stack", "Full Time", "New Grad".</span>
